### Project Objective: 

UFood is a leading food delivery app in Brazil, operating in over a thousand cities. This project aims to enhance the performance of UFood's marketing activities, with a special focus on optimizing marketing campaigns. By exploring and analyzing customer data, the project seeks to provide actionable insights to support more effective budget allocation and strategic decision-making within the marketing department. The key objectives of this project are:

1. Thoroughly explore the data, going beyond simple means and counts to provide in-depth insights, identify cause and effect relationships, and better understand the characteristic features of respondents.
2. Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customer behaviors.
3. Visualize data and provide written reasoning behind the discoveries to improve customer engagement and drive business growth.

Globally, UFood has enjoyed solid revenues and a healthy bottom line over the past three years. However, profit growth prospects for the next three years are not promising. To address this, several strategic initiatives are being considered, one of which is to improve the performance of marketing activities. The marketing department is under pressure to spend its annual budget more wisely, with the hope that successful campaigns will demonstrate the value of this approach and convince skeptics within the company.
