### Project Objective: 

UFood is an established player in the retail food sector and the lead food delivery app in Brazil, present in over a thousand cities. with hundreds of thousands of registered customers and almost one million consumers served annually. The company offers products across five major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish, and sweet products. These products are sold through three sales channels: physical stores, catalogs, and the company’s website.

The key objectives of this project are:

1. Thoroughly explore the data, going beyond simple means and counts to provide in-depth insights, identify cause and effect relationships, and better understand the characteristic features of respondents.
2. Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customer behaviors.
3. Visualize data and provide written reasoning behind the discoveries to improve customer engagement and drive business growth.

Globally, UFood has enjoyed solid revenues and a healthy bottom line over the past three years. However, profit growth prospects for the next three years are not promising. To address this, several strategic initiatives are being considered, one of which is to improve the performance of marketing activities. The marketing department is under pressure to spend its annual budget more wisely, with the hope that successful campaigns will demonstrate the value of this approach and convince skeptics within the company.

### Findings:

- Age Group Spending and Campaign Acceptance: The age group of 31-70 exhibits the highest percentage of accepted campaigns and the highest amount spent, significantly outperforming the 23-30 and 71-85 age groups.
- Impact of Number of Children: As the number of children in a household increases, both the total amount spent and the number of accepted campaigns decrease.
- Educational Influence on Spending and Campaign Acceptance: Customers with higher education levels (graduate, Masters, 2nd cycle, and PhD) tend to spend more and accept more campaigns compared to those with basic education. 
- Marital Status: Marital status does not significantly influence the amount spent on purchases or the acceptance of campaigns
- Purchase Channels: Store purchases are the most common method of purchase among customers, surpassing web and catalog purchases. Additionally, the majority of accepted campaigns are associated with store purchases.
- Product Category Spending and Campaign Acceptance: Wine and meat products see the highest amount spent and the highest rate of accepted campaigns compared to other product categories.

### Recommendations:

- Targeted Campaigns for Age Groups: Focus marketing efforts and campaigns on the 31-70 age group, as they exhibit the highest spending and campaign acceptance rates.
- Family-Oriented Campaigns: Develop and promote campaigns that cater to families with children, offering incentives that appeal to this demographic.
- Education-Based Segmentation: Leverage the higher spending and campaign acceptance rates among customers with advanced education by emphasizing the value and quality of the products.
- Optimize Store-Based Campaigns: Encourage in-store visits through exclusive deals or loyalty programs that can only be redeemed in physical stores.
- Product-Specific Campaigns: Prioritize marketing and promotional efforts on wines and meat products, showcasing their quality and uniqueness to attract and retain customers.

 By implementing these recommendations, UFood can optimize its marketing strategy, improve customer engagement, and drive higher revenue growth.
